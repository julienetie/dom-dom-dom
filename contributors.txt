Style Guide:
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
Soucouyant adheres to the Google JavaScript Style Guide with the exception of 
multiple var declarations.
    http://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml

This is good:
    var a = 1, b = 2, c, d, e;

This is not allowed: 
    var a = 1;
    var b = 2; 
    var c;
    var d;
    var e;

Sort by assigned variables to unassigned, in alphanumeric order.

ES6:
‾‾‾
Soucouyant is built with Babel and ES6 modules but only utillizes light usage 
of the ES6 specification for performance reasons. If in doubt of a transpiled
performance hit it stick to ES5 as this API is dependent on efficnency.
